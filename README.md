## About

A lightweight calculator built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 Expressive. Supports standard arithmetic, scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, ln, sqrt, powers, factorials), parentheses, and percentages. Keeps a full history of past calculations that you can tap to reuse.

The app follows Material 3 Expressive guidelines throughout: expressive button shapes with press animations, M3E motion scheme tokens, dynamic color from your wallpaper, and an adaptive layout that shows a side-by-side history panel on tablets.

## Features

- **Standard & scientific calculator** with trig, log, sqrt, powers, factorial, and constants
- **Calculation history** with swipe-down gesture or tap to open, stored locally with Room
- **Dynamic color** (Material You) follows your wallpaper theme
- **Dark mode** with system, light, and dark options
- **OLED dark theme** with pure black surfaces
- **Adaptive layout** single-pane on phones, dual-pane with history on tablets
- **Expressive animations** using M3E motion scheme and shape morphing on press
- **Edge-to-edge** with proper system bar handling

## Building from source

**Requirements:** Java 21, Android SDK 37

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pingasmaster/calculator.git
cd calculator

# Build (runs lint, assembles debug + release, copies APK to project root)
./build.sh
```
